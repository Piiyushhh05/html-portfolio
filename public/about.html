      Hi, I’m Piyush Sharma — a passionate VFX and 3D Lighting Artist with a</br>
      growing edge in Motion Graphics. I’m currently pursuing a BSc in Animation</br>
      & VFX, where I’ve focused on mastering cinematic lighting, atmosphere</br>
      creation, and dynamic visual storytelling.</p>
      <ul>My portfolio showcases:
      <li>3D lighting setups in diverse moods and environments</li>
      <li>Motion graphic sequences crafted for branding and storytelling</li>
      <li>VFX projects including compositing, simulations, and transitions</li>
      <li>Experimental works as I dive deeper into graphic design and front-end web development</li></p></ul>
      I believe in creating visuals that don't just look good — they feel immersive and impactful.</br>
      With every new project, I push myself to grow technically and artistically.
